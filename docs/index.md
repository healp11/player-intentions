## Project Background

In watching tennis matches, we know that players make some shots with a lot of risk, while other shots are just trying to keep the ball in play. How can we better understand when players are playing more aggressively or not? And what kind of shots are riskier than others?

The purpose of this project is to use statistical models and cutting-edge tracking data to get more insight into player risk-taking and shot intentions.

## Project Goals

The student will use tracking data and Hidden Markov Models to model when players are looking to end a point versus keep the ball in play. This means there are two hidden states.

## Specific Activities

- Get familiar with tennis tracking data
- Conduct some exploratory analysis of shots in play, winners, and error
- Select features for HMM
- Get familiar with the `depmixS4` package in R
- Apply HMM to model risk states 
- Use graphics and summary stats to summarise findings
- Create report and presentation of findings

## Requirements

This project is intended for students with experience with R, some familiarity with state models, and a love of sports.

## Supervisors

The project will be supervised by Professor Di Cook (@dicook) from Monash University and Stephanie Kovalchik (@skoval), a tennis data scientist at Tennis Australia.
