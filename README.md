# player-intentions

This Monash Winter Project will use statistical models to understand tennis player shot selection and intentions. The particular models to be explored are hidden markov models. There are two hidden states in this model.

The project will be co-supervised by Di Cook (@dicook) and Stephanie Kovalchik (@skoval).
